## 📌 OkyNewsletters is a project made in an internship at Oky Solutions.

**OkyNewsletters** is a web application project I & Youssef Baamel made in our internship at Oky Solutions. The web application is basically like any other email-template but customized for the company. aside from using a ready-made template, we created options like add your own template, customize it and you can reuse it.\
The technologies used in this project are Laravel and Vue.js.\
Laravel is primarily used for building custom web apps using PHP. It's a web framework that handles many things that are annoying to build yourself, such as routing, templating HTML, and authentication.\
Vue.js is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
